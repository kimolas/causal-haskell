# causal-haskell

## Introduction
I'm a big fan of Haskell. I also spend some of my time thinking about graphical
models (and maybe network models). This is my attempt at combining the two. It's
only my first attempt, so expect the code to be quite slow. 

In the future, I'd like to use a more sane choice of data structure for storing,
accessing, and searching edges in graphs. I'll probably make a separate branch
for that at some point, once I have too much work invested in the current model. 

## Why Haskell? 
A monad is just a monoid in the category of endofunctors. This makes Haskell
perfectly suited for working with graphical structures.
